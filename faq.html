            <p>
                If the customer has supplied the conveyor, the checkweigher may
                not be controlling the conveyor speed. Verify through the HMI
                that the expected speed is set appropriately to a value greater
                than zero.
            </p>
            <h4 id="clear-wheel">The production run has ended and there are still items in the wheel. How do I get them out?</h4>
            <p>
                The HMI includes a Clear Wheel action, which will index the
                wheel automatically to transfer all items to the outfeed.
            </p>
            <h4 id="photo-reject">The system stopped due to a photogated reject fault. I removed the items at the rejecter, but the system stopped again when the next pocket unloaded. What am I doing wrong?</h4>
            <p>
                When a photogated reject fault occurs, the system does not know
                if the missing item simply slipped on the conveyor or has
                fallen off. Accordingly, the control will invalidate all items
                on the outfeed conveyor. If items on the outfeed conveyor are
                not removed, the will be detected as extra items when the belts
                are restarted. The transfer point from the wheel to the
                conveyor is machine dependent.
